# AI
 
This is my AI project. In this project, my goal is to have working code in which this program can respond to any input that the user inputs, even if it is random.

I currently am utilizing Open AI's API to actually have the capacity to respond to questions, and I am adding the ability for it to browse the internet as well, something that Open AI cannot.

A future goal currently is to add a GUI to make look more fancy.
