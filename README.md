# AI
This is my AI project. In this project, my goal is to have working code in which this program can respond to any input that the user inputs, even if it is random.

I currently am utilizing Open AI's API to actually have the capacity to respond to questions, and I am adding the ability for it to browse the internet as well, something that Open AI cannot. I have just added a GUI and a stock ticker function for my AI project for some extra features in addition to all the previous features it currently possessed.

A future goal may be to add a way to summarize more efficiently and accurately using the summarize command.
